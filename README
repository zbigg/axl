1.
    AXL is a interpreted language similar to C/Perl/PHP/Python but
    obviously different in some features.

    AXL is intended to be embedded in large applications that need
    scripting.

    Well that was wishes of author and that is the vision that i'm
    following. Currently AXL is only perl-like script language
    which can be invoked from script files using command line:
	axl scriptname parameters
    or
	axl -e 'script body' parameters

    and so on.

    You can obviously write script and begin it with line
	#! /usr/local/bin/axl
    or
	#! /usr/bin/env axl

    The second option relies on env program which will search for axl
    interpreter in PATH environment. Note that env is a GNU extension
    and is possible that not all unices will have installed.

2.
    For documentation how to use it see documentation in doc/html
    which after succesfull configuration can be built by executing
    make int doc/ directory.

    Unfortunatelly to build documentation you must have installed lot of
    programs that deal with DocBook:
	* DocBook v3.1 DTD
	* DocBook Utils
	* DocBook DSSSL Stylesheets
	* Jade
	* TeTeX and LateX - to build manpages and postscript version
	* and some programss that i've forgot to mention

    If you don't have them and you don't want to install them you
    can dowload the latest documentaion from this URL
	http://axlhome.host.sk/res/axl/dochtml
    There should be tarred and gzipped version of documentation.
