Making target InstallBin by default installs all programs into \Axl.

If you want to change it then edit "InstallBin.mak" and change that 
DESTDIR variable assignment.

Files that gets installed for now:
	DESTDIR\axl.exe
	DESTDIR\xl.dll | xld.dll
	DESTDIR\modules\stdaxl.dll
	DESTDIR\modules\cgi.dll
	DESTDIR\include\axl\	<-	include files from "include" 
					directory in source root
