This is INSTALL file for

			    AXL
		The Applicaion EXtension Language

1. System wide installation.
    For information how to build in other than UNIX (including MinGW32 and
	Cygwin) environments see build/ENV/readme.txt.

    Simple install that should work on most unix-like systems.
    Makefile/configure build works also on Mingw32 Platform.

		$tar zxvf axl-VER.tar.gz
		$cd axl-VER
		$mkdir bld
		$cd bld
		$../configure
		$make
    	Then as root:
		#make install

    This package is under development and it's possible that you
    encounter compile or make errors especialy or non-linux systems.
    If make doesn't work try gmake which exists on some non-gnu
    systems as BSD-family.

    Package prefix - a root directory - defaults to /usr/local so
    files will be installed in
		/usr/local/bin		- programs: axl, axl_config etc.
		/usr/local/lib		- libxl.so
		/usr/local/lib/axl	- modules: stdaxl.so and others
		/usr/local/include	- AXL C interface headers
		/usr/local/include/axl	- AXL include files

    If you want to change installation root directory you should pass
    	--prefix=mydir argument to configure script eg:
		$./configure --prefix=/mydir

    If $prefix/lib isn't configured as search directory for shared libraries
    please add it to
		* /etc/ld.so.conf	- if it exists
		* LD_LIBRARY_PATH	- environment variable

2. Installation in your home directory.

	$./configure --prefix=$HOME
	$make ; make install
	$echo axl_config --env >> ~/.bashrc

    If you're using shell other than bash you can change ~/.bashrc
    to your shell specific strting script.
    If your shell doesn't support
	export VARNAME="value"
    then examine axl_config --env output and write some equal code in your
    shell laguage or just remember that all those environment variables
    must be set if you want to use AXL or compile with AXL.

3.  Installation of documentaion.
    To build documentation from DocBook SGML you must have DocBook,
    DocBook Stylesheets, DocBook Utils , Jade installed on your system. See

		http://www.docbook.org

    If you have these goto doc directory and type:
		$make

    and as root:
		#make install-man
		#make install-html

    Manual pages for default go to $prefix/share/man/.
    HTML documentaion goes to $prefix/share/doc/axl/html.

    For information how to get pre-built documentation see README.
