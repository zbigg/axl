KNOWN BUGS:
*   AXL: You can close axl.io.stdin/out/err and crash the whole
    interpreter when it tries to write something.
    

NEEDED FEATURES:
* Exception handling and exception flow system
* Easy API for embedding AXL to programs.
* DocAXL parsing style where initial content is C_DOCUMENT (see libxl/lex.c)
    not C_CODE
* ExprAXL parsing style where expression code is generated

DOCUMENTATION:
* There is no C AXL API documentaion.
* There is no StdAXL documentation.
* There is no AXL Language documentation or even good examples.
* Command-line tools documentaion is ready and quite good.

OTHER ISSUES:
* Currently on AXL internal exception raise(SIGSEGV) is called for debug
    program. You can fix it in libxl/proc.c in xlp_except
